## Endless Revolution

### Background

[Endless Revolution][live] is an implementation of the popular 4-arrow rhythm game Dance Dance Revolution where players must press arrow keys as they scroll past a static outline of their respective shapes. The twist is that the gameplay doesn't end until the user misses too many consecutive arrows and causes life points to reach 0.
